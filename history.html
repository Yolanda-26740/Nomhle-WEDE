    <h2>How We Started</h2>
    <p>CaseCraze was founded in 2024 with a simple vision: to create a unique and stylish phone case brand that blends fashion, affordability, and protection. The idea began when the founder noticed a gap in the South African market customers either had to choose between expensive designer cases or low-quality generic covers. CaseCraze was built to bridge that gap.

      What started as a small side project with just a handful of designs quickly grew into a business concept that resonated with young, tech-savvy individuals. By focusing on customer-driven designs, trendy styles, and reliable protection, CaseCraze set itself apart as more than just a phone accessory shop it became a lifestyle brand.
      
      Within the first year, CaseCraze established an online presence through social media marketing and word-of-mouth referrals, attracting attention for its fun branding and affordable prices. The companyâ€™s first milestone was launching its e-commerce website in 2025, offering nationwide delivery and customizable case options.
      
      Today, CaseCraze continues to expand its collection, experimenting with seasonal designs, eco-friendly materials, and collaborations with local artists. While still young, the brand has built a loyal customer base and aspires to become a recognized name in both the South African and global phone accessory markets</p>
